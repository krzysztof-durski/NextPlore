## Project description

NextPlore is an instant, nearby locations recommender for tourists. Save time on research and get tailored recommendations of cool places and activities nearby.

## Who is it for?

NextPlore is a tool designed for tourists who want to stick to a set plan, but at the same time want the freedom to deviate from it and take other, unplanned actions during their trip.

With NextPlore you can explore the city your way and always have some suggestions on what to do next without spending 30 minutes on research just to find out that the place you want to go is closing in 15 minutes.
